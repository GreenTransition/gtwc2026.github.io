The Hellenic Open University organizing the 1st International Green Transition Congress (GTWC), which will be held in Patras (Greece) as well as online.

The theme of GTWC is “Accelerating Towards Sustainability: Innovations in Renewable Energy, Biofuels, GIS, Water Management, and Smart Green Cities”.

The Green Transition World Congress aims to bring together experts, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners from around the globe to exchange ideas, share insights, and collaborate on solutions to foster a more sustainable world. With a focus on renewable energy, biofuels, geographic information systems (GIS), water management, and smart green cities, the conference will address key challenges and opportunities in these crucial areas.

All accepted papers from the Congress will be published in the conference proceedings by IOP and indexed by SCOPUS and the Web of Science

### Conference Tracks:

* Renewable Energy Revolution: Explore the latest developments in solar, wind, hydro, and other renewable energy sources. Discuss innovative technologies, policy frameworks, and investment strategies driving the transition towards a cleaner energy future.
* Biofuels and Sustainable Agriculture: Dive into the realm of biofuels and sustainable agriculture practices. Discuss advancements in biofuel production, agricultural innovations, and the role of biotechnology in creating a more sustainable energy ecosystem.
* Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for Sustainability: Uncover the power of GIS in environmental management, urban planning, natural resource conservation, and disaster response. Learn how GIS technologies are revolutionizing decision-making processes and fostering sustainability across various sectors.
* Water Management and Conservation: Address the challenges of water scarcity, pollution, and unsustainable consumption patterns. Explore innovative water management strategies, wastewater treatment technologies, and community-driven initiatives to ensure equitable access to clean water resources.
* Building Smart Green Cities: Examine the concept of smart cities and how urban planning, IoT technologies, and data-driven solutions can create more sustainable and resilient urban environments. Discuss case studies, best practices, and policy frameworks for building inclusive, low-carbon cities of the future.
* Natural Disaster and Climate Change: Review the evolution of climate change and its impacts on ecosystem services. Propose new technologies for the monitoring and management of air pollutants, exploring environmental practices that can lead to the prevention of global warming and consequently to the mitigation of the resulting natural disasters.
* Circular Economy: Cradle to Grave to Cradle to Cradle transition. Rethink management, innovative technologies, applications and services closing the loops of energy and material, in order to protect the natural capital.
* Natural Hazards for Sustainable Cities: Investigate methods and techniques for assessing the risk of engineering structures exposed to natural hazards. Develop tools for real time monitoring of infrastructures towards the development of smart early warning systems.

### Guide for authors

Please follow the [guide for authors](https://publishingsupport.iopscience.iop.org/author-guidelines-for-conference-proceedings/) provided by IOP Science.

All authors must follow [the ethical guidelines](https://publishingsupport.iopscience.iop.org/ethical-policy-journals/).

### Review Process
 
Abstracts and full-text reports uploaded to the conference system undergo a review procedure. Authors will be notified of the application results in three weeks. Submitted abstracts will be evaluated on the basis of abstracts/proposals. The conference system allows you to submit the full text if your abstract is accepted. Please upload the abstract of your article to the conference system and wait for the results of the evaluation. If your abstract is accepted, you can upload your full text. Your full text will then be sent to at least two reviewers for review.
 
### The conference has a double-blind peer-review process
 
Any paper submitted for the conference is reviewed by at least two international reviewers with expertise in the relevant subject area. Based on the reviewers’ comments, papers are accepted, rejected or accepted with revision. If the comments are not addressed well in the improved paper, then the paper is sent back to the authors to make further revisions. The accepted papers are formatted by the conference for publication in the proceedings.
